# ICFP CONTEST 2023!!

This year we didn't get much planning in ahead of time ... so going remote-async!

Create solutions with this structure:

  solutions/solution-{problem number}-score-{score}-strategy-{ bot name }.json

then we can submit best scores. We should make a script that submits the best ones?
